# Employee Management System

**Project Overview**
This is a web-based Employee Management System built using Python and Django. It helps companies manage their employee records digitally, replacing manual paperwork.

**Key Features**
* **Add Employees:** Easily add new staff details (Name, Dept, Salary, etc.).
* **View Records:** See a complete list of all employees in the database.
* **Search & Filter:** Find employees by Name, Role, or Department instantly.
* **Delete Records:** Remove employees who have left the organization.

**Technologies Used**
* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Django (Web Framework)
* **Database:** SQLite / MySQL
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS

**How It Works**
The system uses a "Model-View-Template" (MVT) architecture.
1.  **Models:** Define the database structure for storing employee info.
2.  **Views:** Handle the logic (like saving data or filtering search results).
3.  **Templates:** The HTML pages that the user sees in the browser.
